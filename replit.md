# BiAS²³ Pro - Behavioral Intelligence Audit System

## Overview
BiAS²³ Pro is a bilingual (English-Indonesian) AI-powered web application designed to analyze behavioral communication patterns using an 8-layer framework. It evaluates communicators and professionals across dimensions like visual behavior, emotional processing, and ethical compliance. The system offers two primary modes: Social Media Pro (for TikTok/Instagram/YouTube account analytics) and Communication (for analyzing speaking and presentation patterns). Its core purpose is to deliver premium, detailed, and actionable behavioral assessments to help users build influence through improved communication.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The frontend is built with React and TypeScript (Vite), utilizing a component-based structure with functional components and hooks. Wouter manages routing, and TanStack React Query handles server state. UI components are crafted with Shadcn/ui on Radix UI, styled using Tailwind CSS, adhering to a Material Design-inspired aesthetic. Key features include language context switching, responsive design, and Inter/JetBrains Mono typography.

### Backend Architecture
The backend is an Express.js and TypeScript RESTful API. It incorporates a rule-based behavioral analysis engine (`bias-engine.ts`) that implements an 8-layer evaluation framework (VBM, EPM, NLP, ETH, ECO, SOC, COG, BMIL) with mode-specific logic. Core API endpoints manage sessions and analysis requests. The system currently uses in-memory storage, with a planned migration to Drizzle ORM and PostgreSQL. Authentication is session-based. An adaptive analysis system tailors recommendations based on user skill levels, and a warmth detection system analyzes communication tone.

### Data Storage Solutions
BiAS²³ Pro employs a privacy-first, disposable data model. Chat history and analysis results are temporary (RAM-based, cleared on server restart). A PostgreSQL database is used only for public/shared data such as Library contributions, rate limiting, and admin panel data, along with basic session metadata. No persistent user analysis data is stored. User sessions are isolated with unique UUIDs. A planned PDF export feature will allow users to download results locally, with the server generating PDFs on-demand without saving files.

### Authentication and Authorization
The application uses cookieless session tracking with client-generated session IDs stored in browser localStorage. Each session is isolated, ensuring anonymity and privacy. There is no user authentication system, as the app is designed to be fully anonymous. Admin authentication uses secure session-based authentication with HttpOnly cookies for managing the analytics dashboard and library.

### UI/UX Decisions
The application features a premium dark theme (#0A0A0A) with pink/cyan gradients and glass-morphism effects. It includes metric cards with gradient text, progress bars, trend indicators, and circular progress components. Dashboards offer comprehensive analytics, including radar chart visualizations. The header is mobile-responsive with a hamburger menu and PWA capabilities are integrated for an installable app experience with custom branding.
