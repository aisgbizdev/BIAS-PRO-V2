## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The frontend utilizes React with TypeScript (Vite), employing a component-based architecture with functional components and hooks. Routing is managed by Wouter, and server state by TanStack React Query. UI components are built with Shadcn/ui on Radix UI, styled with Tailwind CSS, following a Material Design-inspired aesthetic. Key patterns include language context switching, session management, responsive design, and Inter/JetBrains Mono typography.

### Backend Architecture
The backend is built with Express.js and TypeScript, designed as a RESTful API. It features a rule-based behavioral analysis engine (`bias-engine.ts`) implementing an 8-layer evaluation framework (VBM, EPM, NLP, ETH, ECO, SOC, COG, BMIL) with mode-specific logic. Core API endpoints handle sessions, analysis requests, and chat interactions. It currently uses in-memory storage, with planned migration to Drizzle ORM and PostgreSQL. Authentication is session-based, with a future plan for Firebase Authentication. An adaptive analysis system detects user skill levels, and a warmth detection system analyzes communication tone.

### Data Storage Solutions
Currently, data is stored in-memory. A migration to PostgreSQL using Drizzle ORM is planned, with schemas for `sessions`, `analyses`, and `chats` tables.

### Authentication and Authorization
The current system uses session-based tracking with client-generated IDs and token-based rate limiting. Firebase Authentication with Google OAuth is planned for future implementation to manage user sessions and persistent data via Firestore.

### UI/UX Decisions
The application features a premium design system with a dark theme (#0A0A0A), pink/cyan gradients, and glass-morphism effects. It includes metric cards with gradient text, progress bars, trend indicators, and circular progress components. Dashboards are designed for comprehensive analytics, including radar chart visualizations.
