## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The frontend utilizes React with TypeScript (Vite), employing a component-based architecture with functional components and hooks. Routing is managed by Wouter, and server state by TanStack React Query. UI components are built with Shadcn/ui on Radix UI, styled with Tailwind CSS, following a Material Design-inspired aesthetic. Key patterns include language context switching, session management, responsive design, and Inter/JetBrains Mono typography.

### Backend Architecture
The backend is built with Express.js and TypeScript, designed as a RESTful API. It features a rule-based behavioral analysis engine (`bias-engine.ts`) implementing an 8-layer evaluation framework (VBM, EPM, NLP, ETH, ECO, SOC, COG, BMIL) with mode-specific logic. Core API endpoints handle sessions, analysis requests, and chat interactions. It currently uses in-memory storage, with planned migration to Drizzle ORM and PostgreSQL. Authentication is session-based, with a future plan for Firebase Authentication. An adaptive analysis system detects user skill levels, and a warmth detection system analyzes communication tone.

### Data Storage Solutions
**Privacy-First Architecture**: BiAS²³ Pro uses a **disposable data model** for maximum user privacy:
- **In-Memory Storage**: Chat history and analysis results are temporary (RAM-based), automatically cleared on server restart
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Used ONLY for public/shared data:
  - Library contributions (public knowledge base)
  - Rate limiting & abuse prevention
  - Admin panel data
  - Session tracking (basic metadata only, no personal data)
- **No Persistent User Data**: Analysis results and chat conversations are NOT saved to database
- **User Control**: Planned PDF export feature allows users to download their results locally (server does not save files)
- **Session Isolation**: Each user session (identified by unique sessionId in localStorage) maintains completely isolated data - no cross-user data leakage

**Rationale**: This approach maximizes privacy, minimizes server storage costs, and gives users full control over their data. Analysis is one-time use; users can export results if needed but data is not stored server-side.

### Authentication and Authorization
The current system uses **cookieless session tracking** with client-generated session IDs stored in browser localStorage. Each session is isolated with unique UUID-based identifiers. No user authentication system is implemented - the app is fully anonymous and privacy-focused. Firebase Authentication is NOT planned as it contradicts the privacy-first architecture.

### UI/UX Decisions
The application features a premium design system with a dark theme (#0A0A0A), pink/cyan gradients, and glass-morphism effects. It includes metric cards with gradient text, progress bars, trend indicators, and circular progress components. Dashboards are designed for comprehensive analytics, including radar chart visualizations.
