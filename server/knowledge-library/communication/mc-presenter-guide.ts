  mcBasics: {
    role: "MC adalah 'conductor' event - maintain energy, guide flow, connect segments, engage audience. Bukan spotlight stealer, tapi facilitator.",
    
    coreSkills: [
      "Time management - keep event on schedule",
      "Energy management - sustain enthusiasm 2-4 hours",
      "Improvisation - handle unexpected smoothly",
      "Audience reading - adjust based on crowd response",
      "Seamless transitions - connect different segments"
    ],
    
    preparation: {
      rundown: "Hapal rundown event - timing setiap segment, who's next, backup plans",
      research: "Know presenters/speakers - pronunciation names, brief bio, achievements",
      venue: "Visit venue before event - test mic, know stage layout, escape routes",
      backup: "Prepare filler content (jokes, games, trivia) kalau ada delay",
      wardrobe: "Dress code sesuai event theme, comfortable (berdiri 2-4 jam), professional"
    }
  },
  
  // OPENING TECHNIQUES
  opening: {
    formula: "Energy hook (30s) → Welcome (1min) → Event purpose (1min) → Housekeeping (1min) → Introduce first segment",
    
    energyHooks: [
      {
        type: "Crowd participation",
        example: "Good morning everyone! Can I get a GOOD MORNING back? [wait for response] That's better! Let's try again - GOOD MORNING! [louder response] Now we're ready to start!",
        whyItWorks: "Gets audience physically involved immediately, breaks ice"
      },
      {
        type: "Relatable scenario",
        example: "Raise your hand if you woke up this morning thinking 'another event, another MC saying the same thing'? [laugh] Well, I promise to make this different - and more fun!",
        whyItWorks: "Acknowledgement = connection, humor = likability"
      },
      {
        type: "Event relevance",
        example: "We're about to spend the next 3 hours learning strategies that will transform your business. But first, quick question - who here wants to double their revenue in the next 12 months?",
        whyItWorks: "Immediately ties to audience's goals, creates buy-in"
      }

    welcomeStructure: {
      greeting: "Good morning/afternoon everyone! Welcome to [Event Name]!",
      introduction: "My name is [Name], and I'll be your MC/host for today's [event type]",
      honor: "It's an honor to be here with [number] amazing people passionate about [topic]",
      transition: "Before we dive in, let me share what we have in store..."
    },
    
    housekeeping: {
      essentials: [
        "Event duration - 'We'll be together until [time]'",
        "Break schedule - 'Coffee break at X, lunch at Y'",
        "Facilities - 'Restrooms located at..., food/drinks at...'",
        "Phone etiquette - 'Please silent phones, but DO take photos/videos - tag us at [social]'",
        "Emergency - 'Exits located at... In unlikely emergency, follow staff instructions'"
      ],
      delivery: "Keep it brief (max 2 minutes), upbeat tone (not boring announcements)"
    }
  },
  
  // TRANSITIONS & CONNECTORS
  transitions: {
    importance: "Smooth transitions = professional flow. Awkward gaps = energy drop & confusion.",
    
    techniques: {
      recap: "So we just heard from [Speaker] about [key point]. Amazing insights on [topic]!",
      bridge: "That naturally leads us to our next segment, where we'll explore [next topic]",
      contrast: "We've talked about the 'what' - now let's discover the 'how'",
      buildup: "And now, the moment you've all been waiting for..."
    },
    
    speakerIntroductions: {
      formula: "Build credibility (30s) → Create anticipation (15s) → Name reveal + applause cue",
      
      example: {
        buildup: "Our next speaker has 15 years experience in digital marketing, helped 500+ companies grow their online presence, and recently published a bestselling book on social media strategy.",
        anticipation: "Today, she'll share the exact framework she used to grow her startup from zero to 1 million followers in just 18 months.",
        reveal: "Please join me in giving a warm welcome to... [pause for effect] SARAH JOHNSON!",
        applause: "[Start clapping immediately to cue audience]"
      },
      
      tips: [
        "Never read bio verbatim - highlight 2-3 most impressive points",
        "Build energy progressively - don't peak too early",
        "End with name + loud, clear voice + applause",
        "Stay on stage to greet speaker with handshake/hug (transfer energy)"

      options: [
        {
          tactic: "Audience interaction",
          example: "While we set up, let's do quick poll - who here is attending this event for the first time? [engage with responses]",
          duration: "1-3 minutes"
        },
        {
          tactic: "Fun fact/trivia",

        },
        {
          tactic: "Mini Q&A",

          duration: "Flexible"
        },
        {
          tactic: "Social media prompt",
          example: "This is perfect timing to take photos! Tag us @[handle] with #[eventhashtag] - best photo wins [prize]!",

        vocal: "Warm up voice backstage, don't shout (use mic properly), sip water between segments",

        start: "High energy opening to hook attention",

        postLunch: "Re-energize with interactive activity (fight food coma)",
        closing: "Build momentum toward strong finish"

      micFailure: "Stay calm, project voice, move closer to audience, joke: 'Looks like we're going old school!' Keep going while team fixes",
      slidesFail: "Don't panic. 'Looks like slides are taking a break - but I can share the key points without them.' Present from memory.",

      immediate: "Announce calmly: 'We have a slight schedule change - [Speaker] will join us later. Meanwhile...'",
      pivot: "Fill with planned filler content, extend previous Q&A, or bring next segment forward",
      backup: "Always have backup content prepared - interview another speaker, panel discussion, audience participation activity"
    },
    
    awkwardMoments: {
      silenceDuringQA: "Have planted questions ready. 'While you think, let me start with common question I often hear...'",
      offensiveComment: "Redirect politely but firmly: 'Let's keep comments respectful. Moving on...'",

    personalMistakes: {
      nameWrong: "Immediately correct with humor: 'Did I just say [wrong name]? I meant [correct name]! Sorry about that - too much coffee!'",

        "Know what to avoid (sensitive topics unless approved)"

        deep: "Thought-provoking, revelatory - 'What's the hardest decision you've made?'",
        unique: "Not asked elsewhere - 'If you could tell your 20-year-old self one thing...'",
        rapid: "Quick-fire round for energy - '3 words to describe your work style?'"

        active: "Eye contact, nod, show genuine interest (not just waiting for your turn to talk)",

  // COMMON MC MISTAKES
  mistakes: [
    {
      mistake: "Making it about YOU instead of event/speakers",
      why: "Audience came for content, not to hear MC's life story",
      fix: "Keep personal anecdotes brief and relevant. Shine spotlight on others."
    },
    {
      mistake: "Over-scripting - reading rundown robotically",
      why: "Sounds stiff, inauthentic, doesn't adapt to room",
      fix: "Know rundown well, but deliver conversationally. Be present, not just reading lines."
    },
    {
      mistake: "Under-preparing - winging everything",
      why: "Looks unprofessional, can't handle unexpected",
      fix: "Prepare thoroughly, then appear effortless. 'Effortless' takes effort."
    },
    {
      mistake: "Ignoring audience energy/feedback",
      why: "Disconnect = disengagement",
      fix: "Read the room constantly. If energy drops, adjust approach immediately."
    },
    {
      mistake: "Running over time",
      why: "Disrespects everyone's schedule, delays everything",
      fix: "Use timer, cut content if needed, keep strict schedule (better to end early than late)"
